## What is higher order components
A higher order component is a React ccomponent that is made to help us reuse code.

Difinition from the official docs:
> Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Whereas a component transforms props into UI, a higher-order component transforms a component into another component.
